<p>The HTML for my student club page was easier to read, but the Javascript script was more complicated in
the lab 4 assignment.
    The original Javascript was pretty straight-forward. I do feel like writing the script in Vue
    saves time though. I don't prefer using querySelectorAll after writing an app in Vue.
